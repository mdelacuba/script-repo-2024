This is a script repository related to the data processing and analyses of the study "Evidence of habitat specificity in sponge microbiomes from Antarctica".

Exploration of the extent of habitat specificity in the diversity, community composition, and microbial co-occurrence within Antarctic sponge microbiomes, compared to sponge microbiomes from other environments, using massive sequencing of 16S rRNA genes.
